*Surrounded by complete darkness, you wake up and realise you've heard something*
*Suddenly you feel something sharp on your neck ,as if something was trying to strangle you*

Player  (screaming): Aah!  What is going on?!
Unknown: Where is the diamond?!
Player (screaming): I'll never give it to you! Never!
Unknown: We'll see about that.....
Player (screaming): You'll never find it!
Unknown: For god's sake, stop screaming...
Player (screaming): Go to hell!
Unknown: Bye.
Darkness closes in around you.....you lose consciousness.
